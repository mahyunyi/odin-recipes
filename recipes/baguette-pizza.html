    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <li><strong>French Baguette:</strong> 1 piece</li>
        <li><strong>Pizza Sauce:</strong> 1/2 cup, or as needed</li>
        <li><strong>Mozarella Cheese:</strong> 2/3 cup shredded</li>
        <li><strong>Sausage:</strong> 2 ounces cooked and crumbled</li>
        <li><strong>Pepperoni:</strong> 2 ounces mini slices</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Split baguette in half lengthwise. Warm pizza sauce in a microwave-safe bowl until hot, about  45 seconds.</li>
        <li>Spread pizza sauce on baguette, sprinkle on cheese, and scatter sausage and pepperoni on top as desired. Place pizza onto a baking tray.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is golden, about 18 minutes. Optional step: turn on the ovenâ€™s broiler, set a rack 6 inches below the heating element, and broil the pizza for a deeper color, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
