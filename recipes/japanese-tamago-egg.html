    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Tamago is a Japanese rolled omelet, also known as <em>tamagoyaki</em>. The omelet is sweet, has a light texture, and works well when sered over sushi rice with soy and wasabi sauce for dipping.
    </p>
    <p>This is made by rolling together thin layers of fried eggs, then slicing the log into rectangles. Since the egg is mixed with dashi, sugar, and mirin, the finished product has a complex and subtly sweet flavor. Tamago is traditionally served for breakfast or as a sushi ingredient.</p>
